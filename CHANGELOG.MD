# 1.9.0
- Update the mod to work with 1.21
- Changed some things around as `DataComponentType` is now `ComponentType`
- Removed some unfinished parts of the library as they haven't been touched and they broke from the update and I'm not bothered to fix it
- Changed versioning system for the mod to have the game version appended to the end

# 1.8.1
 - Changed EasyData to be used with the InitHandler
