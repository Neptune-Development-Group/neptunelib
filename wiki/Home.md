## [Registration](%wiki%/registration)

This also hooks into our custom data system for easily adding component data to `Items` without all the boilerplate

## [Item Groups](%wiki%/item_groups)
We have a custom system for custom Item Groups that allow you to easily add an Item Groups to your `Items` and `BlockItems`, without needing to hook into an Event to hook it up yourself

On top of the rest of the feature set of neptunelib, we also include a system to easily add new data to `Items`
